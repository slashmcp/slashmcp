# Quick Start: Use LangChain for Your Headphones Scraping Task

## Your Current Approach (Manual)
You're manually executing Playwright commands step by step. This works but requires you to:
- Plan each step
- Execute commands manually
- Compare results yourself

## Better Approach: Use LangChain Agent

### Step 1: Register LangChain Server (One-time)
```
/slashmcp add langchain-agent https://langchain-agent-mcp-server-554655392699.us-central1.run.app

Copy and paste this command:

```
/langchain-agent agent_executor query="Scrape headphones from Craigslist Des Moines Iowa (https://desmoines.craigslist.org/search/ela?query=headphones) and OfferUp, then compare prices to eBay Sold listings and Amazon.
